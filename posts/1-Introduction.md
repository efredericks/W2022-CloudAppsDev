For this course we will be using [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) as our cloud provider, however others such as [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) are common as well. While each provides their own particular flavor, understanding the basics should enable you to transition between one and the other as necessary.

Plus, assuming you are registered for the course at GVSU, you will receive free cloud computing credits (contact me on Blackboard). If you somehow stumbled across this you can get [free credits via Google](https://cloud.google.com/free), however youâ€™re on your own with those.
