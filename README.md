# Cloud Applications Development (CIS680) - W2022

This is the course content page for the _new and improved_ CIS680 at Grand Valley State University. 

*Note that the accelerated (i.e., 5 weeks) variant is still live and will be left up for posterity - that page is deprecated in favor of this one*.

> Please note that our Blackboard page is your home for **all** deadlines! 

As a heads up, the videos were initially recorded in 2020 and I have updated/added/edited where necessary.  Google (and other cloud providers) have a habit of updating their interfaces as often as humanly possible.  If you discover a video (that I have missed) please let me know.
